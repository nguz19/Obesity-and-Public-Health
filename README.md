# Obesity and Public Health Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the prevalence and risk factors associated with obesity by examining the demographic, lifestyle, and familial data of 2,111 individuals. The goal is to develop a logistic regression model to predict obesity risk and propose targeted interventions.

## Methodology 
- Data Source: Kaggle
- Preprocessing: Data Cleaning, Label Encoding, StandardScaler
- Models: Logistic Regression
- Evaluation Metrics: Cross-Validation Accuracy, Precision, Recall

## Key Findings
- The logistic regression model achieved 85% accuracy.
- Strong predictors: Weight, Physical Activity, Family History of Obesity.
- Misclassifications occurred primarily in distinguishing between obesity type II and III.

## Discussion
The findings underscore the multifactorial nature of obesity. Future work includes integrating additional datasets to capture socioeconomic factors and developing a mobile app for community-based health monitoring and personalized recommendations.
